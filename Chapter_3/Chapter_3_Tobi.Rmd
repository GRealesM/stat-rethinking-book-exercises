# Easy questions

```{r Easy questions}
# Set-up
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=1000 )
prior <- rep( 1 , 1000 )
likelihood <- dbinom( 6 , size=9 , prob=p_grid )
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior / sum(posterior)
set.seed(100)
samples <- sample( p_grid , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=TRUE )

```
E1) How much posterior probability lies below p = 0.2?
```{r E1}
# To get this we sum the probability below 0.2 and divide by the number of
# samples taken
threshold <- 0.2
sum(samples<threshold)/length(samples)

```

E2) How much posterior probability lies above p = 0.8?
```{r E2}
# Similar to above but with different threshold
threshold <- 0.8
sum(samples>threshold)/length(samples)
```
E3) How much posterior probability lies between p = 0.2 and p = 0.8?
```{r E3}
# Now apply two thresholds for filtering samples
thresh.low <- 0.2
thresh.high <- 0.8
sum(samples[samples < thresh.high & samples > thresh.low])/length(samples)
```
E4) 20% of the posterior probability lies below which value of p?
```{r E4}
# To find out this we simply look at the 20% percentile or 0.2 quantile which tells us that
threshold <- 0.2
quantile(samples, threshold)
```
E5) 20% of the posterior probability lies above which value of p?
```{r E5}
# Here we take the inverse so look at the 80th percentile or 0.8 quantile
threshold <- 1 - 0.2
quantile(samples, threshold)
```
E6) Which values of p contain the narrowest interval equal to 66% of the posterior probability?
```{r E6}
# I can't run this without the rethinking package but the following should work
# The HDPI or highest density posterior interval does exactly what it says on the tin
prob <- 0.66
HDPI(samples, prob)
```

E7) Which values of p contain 66% of the posterior probability, assuming equal posterior probability both below and above the interval?
```{r E7}
# The PI function should do this I believe
prob <- 0.66
PI(samples, prob)
```

# Medium questions

M1) Suppose the globe tossing data had turned out to be 8 water in 15 tosses. Construct the posterior distribution, using grid approximation. Use the same flat prior as before
```{r M1}
# I believe I can just use the same code as before but changing the number of tosses
# and probability
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=1000 )
prior <- rep( 1 , 1000 )
likelihood <- dbinom( 8 , size=15 , prob=p_grid )
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior / sum(posterior)
```

M2) Draw 10,000 samples from the grid approximation from above. Then use the samples to calculate the 90% HPDI for p.
```{r M2}
# Simply doing what I have already done previously in the easy exercises
samples <- sample( p_grid , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=TRUE )
prob <- 0.9
HDPI(samples, prob)
```

M3) Construct a posterior predictive check for this model and data. This means simulate the distribution of samples, averaging over the posterior uncertainty in p. What is the probability of observing
8 water in 15 tosses?
```{r M3}
post.sampled <- rbinom(1e4, size=15, prob=samples)
print(sum(post.sampled == 8)/length(post.sampled))
hist(post.sampled)
```
M4) Using the posterior distribution constructed from the new (8/15) data, now calculate the probability of observing 6 water in 9 tosses.
```{r M4}

post.sampled <- rbinom(1e4, size=9, prob=samples)
print(sum(post.sampled == 6)/length(post.sampled))
hist(post.sampled)
```
M6) Suppose you want to estimate the Earthâ€™s proportion of water very precisely. Specifically, you
want the 99% percentile interval of the posterior distribution of p to be only 0.05 wide. This means
the distance between the upper and lower bound of the interval should be 0.05. How many times will
you have to toss the globe to do this?
```{r M6}
p_grid <- seq( from=0 , to=1 , length.out=1000 )
prior <- rep( 1 , 1000 )
likelihood <- dbinom( 6 , size=9 , prob=p_grid )
posterior <- likelihood * prior
posterior <- posterior / sum(posterior)
set.seed(100)
samples <- sample( p_grid , prob=posterior , size=1e4 , replace=TRUE )

```


Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
